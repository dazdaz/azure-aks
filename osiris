# For Osiris-enabled deployments, Osiris automatically instruments application pods. When Osiris determines that a deployment’s pods are idle, Osiris scales the deployment to zero replicas.

He mentions that one use-case for project Osiris is with virtualnodes which uses ACI (billed per second)
e.g. multiple replicas not being used when configured through virtualnodes, which decreases the replica count to 0, thus reducing cost even further.
